This not only includes coding and programming skills, but also improving  the process of coding and automating and streamlining my ways around these processes. One area I have vastly improved is my writing of commit messages.</p>\n<p>One bad habit one usualy takes as a solo developer or under time constraints is to ignore documentation. Missing documentation is not important until it is, then, it is really important.</p>\n<p>That’s one area I’m trying to improve in. Good commit messages are a most often ignored form of documentation, so how do we improve them? I have been reading <a href=\"https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/\">how to write a good commit message</a>, it makes sense and it’s easy to follow and got me where I wanted as far as commit messages matter.</p>\n<p>However I became aware about <a href=\"https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.3/\">Conventional Commits</a> thanks to <a href=\"https://dev.to/maxpou/enhance-your-git-log-with-conventional-commits-3ea4\">Enhance your git log with conventional commits</a>. I really liked the article and started writting conventional commits by hand for the last couple of days.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Automating conventional commit messages globally","date":"March 17, 2019"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/automating-conventional-commit-messages-globally/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/update-redux-form-fields-using-bindactioncreators/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Updating redux-form fields using bindActionCreators"}},"next":null}}
