In Asian\nsupermarkets, these eggs are sometimes sold covered in a thick layer of salted\ncharcoal paste. The eggs may also be sold with the salted paste removed,\nwrapped in plastic, and vacuum packed. From the salt curing process, the\nsalted duck eggs have a briny aroma, a gelatin-like egg white and a\nfirm-textured, round yolk that is bright orange-red in color.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n  <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/19d0a1dd297d346bf839219f3d793783/5979c/new.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 480px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 80%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"Chinese Salty Egg\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/19d0a1dd297d346bf839219f3d793783/5979c/new.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/19d0a1dd297d346bf839219f3d793783/c0f52/new.jpg 148w,\n/static/19d0a1dd297d346bf839219f3d793783/da7c2/new.jpg 295w,\n/static/19d0a1dd297d346bf839219f3d793783/5979c/new.jpg 480w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Hello World","date":"January 04, 2019"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/hello-world/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/hi-folks/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"New Beginnings"}},"next":null}}
