Essentially, it involves teaching computers to learn from data and make decisions or predictions based on that learning.</p>\n<h3>Why Does It Matter?</h3>\n<p>Machine learning has become an integral part of modern technology, with applications ranging from recommendation systems on platforms like Netflix to fraud detection in banking. Understanding and leveraging these technologies can provide significant advantages for developers, including those who specialize in Ruby.</p>\n<h3>Types of Machine Learning</h3>\n<p>Machine learning can be broadly categorized into three types:</p>\n<p><strong>1. Supervised Learning</strong> In supervised learning, the algorithm learns from labeled data. This can be thought of as a teacher-student relationship where the teacher (labeled data) guides the student (algorithm) to learn the correct answers.</p>\n<p><strong>Example:</strong> Predicting house prices based on features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, and location. The algorithm learns from historical data where the house prices are known.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Unsupervised Learning</strong> Unsupervised learning involves training algorithms on unlabeled data. The goal is to find hidden patterns or intrinsic structures in the data.</p>\n<p><strong>Example:</strong> Clustering customer data to segment them into different groups based on their purchasing behavior. The algorithm identifies patterns without being explicitly told what to look for.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Reinforcement Learning</strong> Reinforcement learning is about training algorithms to make a sequence of decisions. The agent learns to achieve a goal in an uncertain, potentially complex environment.</p>\n<p><strong>Example:</strong> A game-playing AI that learns to play chess or Go. The algorithm improves its strategy through trial and error, receiving rewards for good moves and penalties for bad ones.</p>\n<h3>Real-World Applications</h3>\n<p>Machine learning is used in a wide range of applications, including:</p>\n<p><strong>Recommendation Systems:</strong> Platforms like Netflix, Amazon, and Spotify use machine learning to suggest content based on user preferences.</p>\n<p><strong>Fraud Detection:</strong> Banks use machine learning to detect unusual patterns that may indicate fraudulent activity.</p>\n<p><strong>Image Recognition:</strong> Social media platforms use machine learning to automatically tag people in photos.</p>\n<p><strong>Natural Language Processing:</strong> Chatbots and virtual assistants use machine learning to understand and respond to human language.</p>\n<p>As a Rubyist, you might be wondering how machine learning fits into your workflow. The truth is, machine learning can enhance your Ruby applications in numerous ways. Whether you’re building a web application, a data analysis tool, or an automation script, incorporating machine learning can make your projects smarter and more efficient.</p>\n<p>Machine learning is a powerful tool that can transform the way you approach software development. In the upcoming posts, I will dive deeper into the practical aspects of machine learning, including setting up your environment, understanding key concepts, and building your first machine learning models in Ruby.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"What is Machine Learning?","date":"September 19, 2024"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/18-machine-learning/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/17-implementing-the-saga-design-pattern/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Implementing the Saga Design Pattern in Ruby on Rails"}},"next":null}},"staticQueryHashes":["2418676009","3128451518"]}
