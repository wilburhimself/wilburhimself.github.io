This may demotivate people and cause them to feel frustrated and stuck.</p>\n<p>Because it doesn’t provide students the chance to apply what they’ve learned to a real-world assignment, tutorial hell is wrong. Tutorials sometimes concentrate on teaching certain methods or technology; however, they don’t always offer a thorough grasp of how to create and manage a real-world project.</p>\n<p>It’s crucial to mix learning through tutorials with practical experience if you want to avoid tutorial hell and achieve real progress. This involves using what has been taught on practical tasks and enhancing one’s skill set over time.</p>\n<p>The following advice can help you avoid tutorial hell:</p>\n<p><strong>Set precise objectives and benchmarks.</strong> Have a clear idea of what you want to accomplish, and then define goals and benchmarks to evaluate your progress.</p>\n<p><strong>Build practical projects</strong>. To obtain practical experience, apply the knowledge you have gained from tutorials to practical projects.</p>\n<p><strong>Work on projects with other developers</strong> or contribute to open-source initiatives to increase your abilities and expertise.</p>\n<p>To gain from their knowledge and advance your abilities, <strong>get feedback on projects</strong> from seasoned developers.</p>\n<p>Keep up with changing technology and methods by <strong>continuing to learn new things</strong> and broadening your skill set.</p>\n<p>To sum up, tutorial hell is a prevalent issue experienced by aspiring programmers and developers. It’s crucial to strike a balance between learning through tutorials and practical experience while also consistently improving your abilities in order to prevent this issue and achieve significant progress. Developers may escape tutorial hell and make significant strides in becoming productive programmers by paying attention to these pointers.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Breaking free from tutorial hell","date":"February 23, 2023"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/breaking-free-from-tutorial-hell/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/automating-conventional-commit-messages-globally/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Automating explicit commit story with Conventional Commits"}},"next":null}},"staticQueryHashes":["2418676009","3128451518"]}
