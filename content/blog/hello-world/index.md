![New Stuff](./new.jpg)

This is my first post on this blog, again.

I have been working for about a year now in a [great company](http://pipelinedeals.com/) and part of
the effect of working with a great team is that you evolve into their strengths. Some time ago I used to blog
frequently, and it was a part of my daily routine to write more. I want to pick it up again, and I set a goal for myself
to improve my communication skills and I feel part of it is to start writing more again.

The intention is to make this a technical blog, but bare in mind that this is mine and I will post what I feel.

Thanks and welcome.
