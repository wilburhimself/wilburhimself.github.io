When a SQL query is slow, I don't jump straight to indexing or rewriting.
First, I step back and ask:

ðŸ“Œ Is this query always slow?
ðŸ“Œ Or does it degrade under load?

That tells me whether I'm chasing a design issue or a scaling issue.
From there, here's the process I follow ðŸ‘‡

----------------------------------------

1. **Run EXPLAIN (ANALYZE)**
   This is home base. I'm looking for full table scans, nested loops, row misestimates, and I/O-heavy operations. It tells me where the real cost lives.

2. **If it's scanning too much, check indexing**
   Missing or misused indexes are often the low-hanging fruitâ€”especially on WHERE, JOIN, or ORDER BY.

3. **If row counts look huge, check filtering**
   Can I apply filters earlier? Push conditions closer to the base tables?

4. **If the query joins multiple big tables, simplify**
   Sometimes restructuring or denormalizing a bit is worth the tradeoff.

5. **If I see repeated queries inside loops, it's probably N+1**
   This usually comes from lazy loading in ORMs. I preload or rewrite to batch instead.

6. **If a lot of unnecessary columns are being fetched, I reduce the payload**
   But only after confirming it's part of the problem. SELECT * isn't always badâ€”it depends on what's being returned and why.

7. **If the query is still slow but the data doesn't change often, I consider caching**
   This can be a game-changerâ€”but only when staleness is acceptable and cache invalidation is manageable.

8. **For high-volume or time-based data, I look at partitioning**
   PostgreSQL partitioning works best when queries align with the partition key (e.g. time windows). Otherwise, it can add complexity with no gain.

9. **If this query runs fine alone, but collapses under concurrency, it's time to look at connection pooling, locks, and transaction scopes**
   Sometimes the query isn't the problemâ€”the context is.

----------------------------------------

ðŸ’¡ These aren't just tips, they're questions I ask the system.
Query performance isn't solved with a checklist. It's diagnosed.
