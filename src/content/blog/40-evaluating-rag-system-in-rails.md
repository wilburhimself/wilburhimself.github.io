You've built a RAG system in Rails, but how do you prove it's effective? This post moves beyond simple smoke tests, introducing a robust evaluation framework you can build directly in your application. We'll cover key metrics like faithfulness, answer relevancy, and context precision, and provide Ruby code samples for creating a Rake task to automate the evaluation process using an LLM-as-a-judge, ensuring your AI features are not just clever, but correct.

### The Problem with "It Looks Good"

Anecdotal testing is a start, but it's not scalable or objective. We need a way to measure the performance of our RAG system over time.

```ruby
# Code sample for a simple Rake task to run evaluations
namespace :rag do
  desc "Evaluate the RAG system against a set of questions"
  task :evaluate => :environment do
    # ... implementation to come ...
  end
end
```

### Key Evaluation Metrics

1.  **Faithfulness:** Does the answer come directly from the provided context?
2.  **Answer Relevancy:** Does the answer directly address the user's question?
3.  **Context Precision:** Was the retrieved context relevant to the question?

### Building the Evaluation Task

We will build a Rake task that iterates through a predefined set of questions and answers, scores them using an LLM, and reports the results.

```ruby
# More detailed code sample showing the evaluation logic
class RagEvaluator
  def initialize(question, answer, context)
    @question = question
    @answer = answer
    @context = context
  end

  def evaluate
    # ... logic to call an LLM to score faithfulness, relevancy, etc. ...
  end
end
```

By automating this process, we can catch regressions, test new prompt strategies, and confidently improve our AI features.
