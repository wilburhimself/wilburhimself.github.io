The most reliable systems I've built didn't come from genius. They came from patience.

They weren't born in a sprint. They grew, over dozens of refactors, name changes, and conversations.

Early on, I thought good architecture meant predicting everything upfront.

Now I know: it means changing direction without breaking trust.

Stability isn't rigid. It's resilient.

True craftsmanship isn't about locking things down, it's about making change feel safe.

Fragile systems demand control. Durable ones welcome change.
