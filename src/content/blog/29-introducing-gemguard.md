title: "üö® Introducing GemGuard: Automated Security for Ruby Gems (Scan, SBOM, Typosquat, Auto-Fix)"
date: "2025-08-11"
excerpt: "Peak traffic was crushing our API‚ÄîP95 latency at 450ms, dashboards taking 5 seconds to load, and users complaining of ‚Äúslow mornings.‚Äù By introducing a Redis caching layer designed around real access patterns, not just generic key-value storage, we cut P95 latency in half, reduced DB CPU load from 85% to 45%, and eliminated the majority of timeouts. This is the story of how intentional caching turned a struggling system into one that scaled gracefully."

## TL;DR
- ‚úÖ Scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities (OSV.dev + Ruby Advisory DB)
- üïµÔ∏è Detect typosquat packages before they bite
- üìú Generate SPDX / CycloneDX SBOMs
- üõ† Auto-fix vulnerable gems safely
- ‚ö° Clean CLI + CI-ready
- **Version:** 1.1.x

---

## Why GemGuard?
Because security shouldn‚Äôt be an afterthought. It should be:
- **Pragmatic** ‚Äì only what matters, no noise
- **Fast** ‚Äì instant feedback in dev or CI
- **Integrated** ‚Äì works with your normal Ruby workflow

---

## What is GemGuard?
GemGuard is a lightweight Ruby security tool that:

- Scans your `Gemfile.lock` for known vulnerabilities
- Detects typosquat risks via fuzzy matching
- Generates SBOMs (SPDX and CycloneDX)
- Auto-fixes vulnerable gems with safe version upgrades
- Plays nicely with CI/CD

#### Installation
```bash
# Add to your Gemfile (recommended for projects)
gem "gem_guard", "~> 1.1"

# Or install globally
gem install gem_guard
```

#### Verify:

```bash
gem_guard version
# => 1.1.x
```

#### Quick Start

Scan your project:

```bash
gem_guard scan
# ‚úÖ No vulnerabilities found!
# or exits non‚Äëzero if issues are found
```

#### Detect typosquats:

```bash
gem_guard typosquat
# No potential typosquat dependencies found.
```

#### Generate an SBOM:

```bash
gem_guard sbom --format spdx --output sbom.spdx.json
gem_guard sbom --format cyclonedx --output bom.cdx.json
```

#### Auto‚ÄëFix Vulnerabilities

Preview (dry run):

```bash
gem_guard fix --dry-run
```

### Apply fixes (creates a Gemfile.lock backup by default):

```bash
gem_guard fix
# üì¶ Created backup: Gemfile.lock.backup.2025...
# ‚úÖ Updated nokogiri to 1.18.9
# üîÑ Running bundle install to update lockfile...
```

Options:

- `--interactive`: confirm each update
- `--no-backup`: skip lockfile backup
- `--gemfile`, --lockfile: custom paths

Tip: Re-scan after fixing

```bash
gem_guard scan
```

#### Clean CLI
```bash
gem_guard --help
# config, scan, typosquat, sbom, fix, version
```

#### Exit codes:

- 0: success / no vulns
- 1: vulnerabilities found
- 2: errors (e.g., missing files)

### CI/CD Integration (GitHub Actions)
```yaml
name: security-scan
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  gemguard:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: ruby/setup-ruby@v1
        with:
          ruby-version: '3.3'
          bundler-cache: true
      - run: gem install gem_guard
      - run: gem_guard scan --format json > gemguard-report.json
      - run: gem_guard typosquat --format json > typosquat-report.json
      - name: Upload reports
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: gemguard-reports
          path: |
            gemguard-report.json
            typosquat-report.json
```

Fail builds on vulnerabilities (default behavior). If you want non-blocking scans (e.g., on main), wrap with || true or use matrix strategies.

#### Configuration

Create .gemguard.yml:

```yaml
lockfile: Gemfile.lock
output:
  format: table   # table | json
typosquat:
  similarity_threshold: 0.82
  risk_levels:
    high: 0.9
    medium: 0.85
```

View current config:

```bash
gem_guard config --show
```

### Why GemGuard?
- Minimal setup, zero noise
- Pragmatic defaults, sensible exit codes
- Works offline for typosquat via fallback popular gems
- Well-tested (RSpec), standardrb formatting
- Designed for CI from day 1

### How It Compares
- Bundler Audit: great for advisories; GemGuard adds typosquat + SBOM + auto-fix
- OSV-Scanner: broad ecosystem; GemGuard is Ruby-first with tighter UX and auto-fix
- Trivy/Grype: container focus; GemGuard slots into pure-Ruby pipelines easily

Use GemGuard standalone or alongside your existing stack.

### Roadmap
- Enriched advisories (GHSA/CVE links, CVSS)
- Optional dependency graph visualizations
- Interactive TUI
- More fix strategies and guards

### Contribute / Feedback
- Issues/PRs welcome: add tests, keep it minimal and intention-revealing
- Prefer failing test ‚Üí minimal fix ‚Üí refactor
- Security disclosures: see SECURITY.md

### Try It Now
```bash
gem install gem_guard
gem_guard scan
gem_guard typosquat
gem_guard fix --dry-run
```
