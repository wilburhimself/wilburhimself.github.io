# HOW I APPROACH A SLOW BACKGROUND JOB

When a background job runs slow, I don't just add retries or throw more threads at it.

I step back and ask:

 * üìå Is this a problem with the job itself?
 * üìå Or with the system around it?

That distinction matters, because a lot of performance issues look like code problems but are actually systemic.

Here's how I break it down üëá

---

### Check the payload size

Large job payloads (objects, blobs, nested data) hurt Redis performance, clog queues, and slow deserialization. Passing just IDs keeps jobs fast and retryable.

‚û°Ô∏è Small payloads support a healthier system.

---

### Isolate external calls

APIs, file systems, DB writes or anything that depends on I/O should be isolated, timed, and retried safely.

‚û°Ô∏è External latency isn't your job's fault, but it becomes your system's problem.

---

### Profile the internals

If the job is CPU-bound (like resizing images or crunching data), Ruby might struggle. I measure performance and consider: does this work belong here? Should it move to a native extension, separate service, or queue tier?

‚û°Ô∏è Sometimes the fix is not optimization, but extraction.

---

### Batch when you can

N+1 isn't just a query problem, it happens in jobs too. If it's looping over 100 records, maybe it should fetch and process them in one pass.

‚û°Ô∏è Batched jobs reduce I/O load and system thrash.

---

### Check for lock contention or shared resources

If multiple jobs touch the same records, deadlocks and retries follow. I look at DB locks, Sidekiq uniqueness, or whether the job needs idempotency guarantees.

‚û°Ô∏è Concurrency isn't free. Structure matters.

---

### Check retry patterns in context

Retries can hide deeper failures. I check whether retries spike during deploys, outages, or congestion. I also ask: does this job need retries or is that masking a design flaw?

‚û°Ô∏è Bad retry behavior is usually a system smell, not just a job bug.

---

### Review queue structure and load

Is this job stuck behind heavy ones? Competing for threads? Underprovisioned? Sidekiq lets you shape priority and throughput‚Äîbut the defaults won't save you.

‚û°Ô∏è Queue topology is system design, not config trivia.

---

### Trace the upstream trigger

Sometimes the job's slow because it shouldn't exist. Maybe the work should be done earlier (precomputed), or later (lazily), or not at all (deleted feature).

‚û°Ô∏è Job design is downstream from system clarity.

---

üí° Slow jobs don't always mean bad code. Sometimes they reveal load imbalances, architectural mismatches, or flawed assumptions.

So I go back to the start: Is the slowness inside the job or around it?

The answer shapes everything that follows.
