# Flow Over Frameworks: What Really Helps Teams Move Faster

Scrum is too rigid, Kanban is too loose, the teams that move fastest? They blend both.

This is a pattern I've seen in many teams I've worked with startups as well as mid-sized orgs. The teams that ship consistently without burning out don't follow strict rules; they focus on flow.

Here's what those teams do differently:

- Drop sprint commitments to focus on flow, not hard timelines
- Keep retros, they compound improvement over time
- Limit WIP, again, focus on flow
- Use short planning cycles, alignment without ceremony
- Track output, more signal, less illusion
- Communicate progress asynchronously, standups become optional
- Limit exploration time so learning stays productive
- Aggressively prune the backlog, clutter kills momentum

It's not really about following a framework—just keeping enough structure to reflect, realign, and keep moving.
